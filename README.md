## Change Log
### Monday 8/13/2018 3:30 PM: Scaffolding set up and first readme update completed.
### Monday 8/13/2018 4:30 PM: Program shows menu and prompts user.
### Monday 8/13/2018 5:26PM: Program runs smoothly for corner cases.
### Tuesday 8/14/2018 1:04PM: Test_plan.md created.
### Tuesday 8/14/2018 5:04PM: Menu display function works when the user types menu, menu now stored in dicts, no tests yet.
### Tuesday 8/14/2018 6:52PM: Basic functionality is there, but there is some erratic behavior with order display.
### Tuesday 8/14/2018 9:05PM: Mostly up to speed, but lacking tests!
### Tuesday 8/14/2018 9:25PM: Feeling good, and tests are there. I can't figure out what else I can test based on the assignment as all the functions seem to take in user input or merely print.
### Tuesday 8/14/2018 9:49PM: Polishing touches with sales tax and neatening up display and prices.
### Wednesday 8/15/2018 3:12PM: Day 3: Added 9 items to each menu.
### Wednesday 8/15/2018 3:49PM: Added a sides display function that displays sides multiple times.
### Wednesday 8/15/2018 4:12PM: Now have a subtotal when items added to cart and each item starts with a stock quantity of 10.
### Wednesday 8/15/2018 7:10PM: Have a CSV file and am printing the data to the console, but it has not been formatted yet. The program still draws from the old menu.
### Wednesday 8/15/2018 7:48PM: The CSV data works like a buggy version of my old hard-coded menu. When item added to cart, it adds a bunch of times. I need to figure out another way to store the count for each item.
### Wednesday 8/15/2018 8:14PM: Now each item has a count again, so I can use my original code without that bugging. Still adding way too mcuh to cart, though, and not totalling quite right.
### Wednesday 8/15/2018 8:42PM: Fixed refactoring indent bug that I hadn't noticed was why everything was breaking. Now I seem to have basic functionality again. Now to add some of the other lab requirements.
### Wednesday 8/15/2018 9:14PM: Fixed display category bug. Too many for loops, deleted whole function.
### Wednesday 8/15/2018 9:34PM: Submission for the day. Totaling bug
